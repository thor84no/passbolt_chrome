   * Perform an asynchronous request to the addon-code.
   *
   * By default there is no mechanism to
   *
   * The object returned by the request function is a jQuery.Deferred. The
   * object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable. You
   * can use any of the methods mentioned in the following documentation :
   * @see http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
   *
   * The returned jQuery.Deferred object is resolved once the addon-code
   * has processed the request and has sent back a response.
   *
   * How does it work ?
   * ------------------
   *
   * 1. Make a request to the addon-code
   *
   * To make a request to the addon-code, you can do as following
   *
   * ```
   * passbolt.request('request_name')
   *   .then(function(response_arg1, response_arg2) {
   *     // Do something in case of success
   *   })
   *   .then(null, function(response_arg1, response_arg2) {
   *     // Do something in case of failure
   *   });
   *
   * 1.1 How the request layer is implemented
   *
   * For each request a token is generated. This token will help to identify
   * each request and its associated callbacks and ensure the resolution of the
   * good callbacks once the request is completed.
   *
   * The token is added as parameter and should be sent back in the addon code
   * response.
   *
   * The request layer use the Firefox communication mechanism with the port
   * object to trigger the request.
   *
   * ```
   * self.port.emit('request_name', token [, arg1, arg2 ..]);
   * ```
   *
   * 2. Addon-code response
   *
   * The addon-code should send a response to all requests disregard of the
   * status. The format of the response is as follow.
   *
   * 2.1 In case of error
   *
   * ```
   * worker.port.emit('request_name.complete', token, 'ERROR' [, arg1, arg2 ..]);
   * ```
   *
   * 2.1 In case of success
   *
   * ```
   * worker.port.emit('request_name.complete', token, 'SUCCESS' [, arg1, arg2 ..]);
   * ```
   *
   * 2.1 Following the progress of a request
   *
   * ```
   * worker.port.emit('request_name.progress', token, 'PROGRESS' [, arg1, arg2 ..]);
   * ```
   *
   * 3. Treatment of the response by the content code
   *
   * Once the content code receives the request response, it execute the
   * callbacks that have been associated to the request. It is able to
   * retrieve the references with the token that is exchanged between the
   * addon-code and the content code.
   *
   * @param message The request name
   * @returns {jQuery.Deferred}
   */
